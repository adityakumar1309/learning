The programming question was that given a binary matrix find the rectangle having the maximum area with column swaps allowed. Also, tell the minimum number of swaps needed.

K reversal of link list.

## HOT QUESTION
you are given a matrix that has either 0 or 1. You can perform only one operation on matrix. It is to swap two columns of a matrix.
Your task is to optimally swap these columns such that you get a largest rectangular submatrix that consist of only 1's. Make sure that the no of swap opertion you performed are minimum.
